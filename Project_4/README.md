# A Strategy Pattern Project

#  The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors, encapsulate each one as a separate class, and make them interchangeable at runtime. This pattern helps in selecting an appropriate algorithm or behavior dynamically, without coupling the client code to specific implementations.
